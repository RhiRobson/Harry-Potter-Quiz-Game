# Harry-Potter-Quiz-Game

  ![Game Logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be0d7e6b-b4b5-45f8-a21a-c8cc4479c8ee)

A multiple choice style game with questions based on the Harry Potter Series. The game is based on levels, if you can reach level 10 you will win the House Cup. You have 3 Horcruxes (lives) to help you complete the game. If you answer a question incorrectly and you have no Horcruxes, you loose.

I chose to make a quiz game as I am a member of a quiz team and enjoy taking part in Pub Quizes, Harry Potter is my specialist subject so it was the ideal choice.
